<h2>Hi, Silicon Valley's Perl Engineers</h2>

Hi, Silicon Valley's Perl Engineers. I'm Yuki Kimoto, the president of Perl Club, ltd.

We decides that the place of the Perl information activiteis in the online is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley">Silicon Valley</a>.

At first, I introduce Perl. Perl is the highest misunderstanding language in Silicon Valley.

We resolve the misunderstanding with the fair, fresh, healthful Perl informaiton.
