<h2>Hi, Silicon Valley's People</h2>

Hi, Silicon Valley's People. I'm Yuki Kimoto, the one of messengers of Perl.

I decides that the place of the Perl information activiteis in the online is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley">Silicon Valley</a>.

At first, I introduce Perl. Perl is the highest misunderstanding language in Silicon Valley.

We resolve the misunderstanding with the fair, fresh, healthful Perl informaiton.
